****** Background: ******
--------------------------------------------------

While doing code KATA, I thought of practicing the TDD concepts in an applciation which I have done before without these concepts.

***** Scenario: ******
---------------------------------------------------

This Shopping cart issues two types of voucher for customers to gain discounts on shopping baskets. 
 

Gift Voucher:
1) Can be redeemed against the value of a basket 
2) Multiple gift vouchers can be applied to a basket. 

Offer vouchers : 
1) Have a threshold that needs to be matched or exceeded before a discount can be applied 

e.g. £5.00 off of baskets totalling £50 

2) Only a single offer voucher can be applied to a basket. 

Offer and Gift vouchers can be used in conjunction. If a customer applies an offer voucher to a basket that will not satisfy the threshold or a customer removes an item/changes an items quantity resulting in a vouchers not being valid, a message will be displayed to the customer. 

Gift vouchers can only be redeemed against non gift voucher products and purchase of gift 

vouchers do no contribute to discountable basket total. 

This application represents a basket and has the ability to handle the following 

scenarios:
